# Pyxel PONG Practice

This is a beginner Pyxel project to recreate the classic game "PONG".

The main purpose is to learn how to use Pyxel in Python.
To be able to upload my work to GitHub.

Created with the assistance of 90% ChatGPT.
The impetus for creating the project came from a video of a vtuber explaining how to use Pyxel.
